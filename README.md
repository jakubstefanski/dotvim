# dotfiles

My Vim configuration extracted from [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/jakubstefanski/dotfiles).

## Installation

Run `./install.sh`. The script will prompt before replacing any existing
files. It is idempotent and can be used to ensure that all
relevant files are links to this repository.
